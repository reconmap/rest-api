# Reconmap Rest API

The Reconmap API is a RESTful API that allows any of the clients (Web, CLI, Mobile) to manipulate any of the Reconmap's
entities: projects, tasks, commands, reports, users, etc. With the API you can extend Reconmap in any way you can
imagine.

This is a component of many in the [Reconmap's architecture](https://reconmap.com/development/architecture.html).

## Runtime requirements

- Docker
- Docker compose
- Make

## Documentation

The API specs have been documented using the **OpenAPI** specification. You can use the
interactive [OpenAPI UI](https://demo.api.netfoe.com/docs/) to play with it.

## Build instructions

The first thing you need to do is build the containers and prepare the app. This can be achieved by invoking the default
make target:

```sh
make
```

Once the containers are built, and the app prepared, you can run the docker services with the following command:

```sh
make start
```

If everything went ok you should be able to use curl or any other HTTP client (eg your browser) to call the API:

```sh
curl http://localhost:5510
```
